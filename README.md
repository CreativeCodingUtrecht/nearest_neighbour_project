# nearestneighborproject

The Nearest Neighbor Project(NNP) is focussing on using creative (coding) methodologies in order to play with urban datasets.

From April 2021 onwards we've been reviewing datasets and since September 2021 we're focussing on the concept of zero-waste imaginaries in the Utrecht area called Werkspoorkwartier.
in this repo we collect datasets and all other relevant materials for this project.
